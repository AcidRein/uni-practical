-- Random Integers Test description--
With 5 random Integers between 1-10 inclusive, 

The Maximum sum occurs when all 5 Integers are equal to 10:
Maximum Value = 50

The Minimum sum occurs when all 5 Integers are equal to 1:
Minimum Value = 5

By running 1000 simulations of the sums of 5 random Integers,
The average sum was ~= 27.5

(Set 'FINDAVERAGE = true' to run this simulation)
