-- Describe shape of Graph --
since vector B is the cubed result of A, the graph of B should 
look similar to and have same features as the default cubic function 'x^3', 
where it starts from the bottom, has two inflection points, and increases to infinity

as vector C is the result of 2^(A(i)), and vector A starts from -10 increasing at .5 interval til 10,
We can expect the graph of C to start at a very small y-value, then increases as A(i) increases.
This would look like an exponential graph.
